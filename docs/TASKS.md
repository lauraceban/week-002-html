# Coding Tasks

For the following code tasks, focus purely on completing them with HTML. It can be tempting to introduce styling (CSS) but we will cover this next week.

Make sure you COMMIT to Git version control after completing each task. 

## 1) Fork the Tech Returners HTML repo.

Using GitHub fork the Tech Returners repo.

https://github.com/techreturners/004-html

## 2) Clone the repository to your machine

Replacing USERNAME with your username.

```git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/004-html.git```

You should now see the starter index.html file.

## 3) Give your page a title

Firstly we probably want to give our page a title. The title is shown on the browser window title.

For example the BBC website has a page title of **BBC - Home** as shown below.

**NOTE** Don't forget to COMMIT your work to git.

## 4) Introduce a heading

You're ToDo application will need some form of heading.

## 5) Introduce the input fields and button

Next update your HTML and introduce the input fields.

**HINT** 

Take a read over https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp

## 6) Paragraphs for showing how many tasks are left

The next section on the page shows how many tasks are left to complete. Try putting this in paragraph tags.

## 7) The final piece is the tag list.

Create the tag listing that shows the task name, add button and delete button. 

Without utilising CSS or being responsive this is probably best done using a table.

**HINT** 

Take a read over https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp

## 8) Push your code up to GitHub

Remember the Git lecture? Now we're going to push those commits you have made up to GitHub and your origin server.

```
git push origin master
```

# Preparation Tasks

The following tasks are important and really facilitate both the depth of learning as well as set you up for next week.

## 1) Embed your HTML knowledge

The following videos will help embed the core HTML knowledge.

HTML Intro Part One - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk

HTML Intro Part Two - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ13lX20FqU

From HTML4 to HTML5 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdDIsqelEh0

HTML5 Facts and Myths - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/09/html5-the-facts-and-the-myths/

(For those interested in the frontend - Smashing Magazine is a good resource to bookmark.)

## 2) Identify and name sections from your webpage

Draw a diagram that identifies the core sections of your web page. Later on in the course we'll be using this to split up your code base into [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) components and it will also be useful for the CSS session next week.

It will be similar to the **HTML Page Structure** section on this page.

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp

The examples below show how the sections might be identified.

with sections identified goes to this:

The image should be placed in the 'docs' directory.

Once you have created your image. Add it to your source code and COMMIT it. Then PUSH it up to origin as per previous tasks.

## 3) Make a list of dynamic parts of the application.

Create a file that lists dynamic parts of the user interface (UI). The file should be in the 'docs' directory.

Some of the application is entirely dynamic. IE. The user will have done some actions so as a developer we cannot predict what will be shown.

For example the number next to **Things to do** is dynamic because we cannot predict how many items the user will add to their list.

Can you see any more dynamic pieces? Can you predict any problems with the dynamic pieces?

Once you have created your list. Add it to your source code and COMMIT it. Then PUSH it up to origin as per previous tasks.
