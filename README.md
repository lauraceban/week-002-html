# Week 2 - HTML

## Introduction

Welcome to week 2. For the course of this week we'll be focusing on HyperText Markup Language, better known as HTML.

Over the duration of the course we're going to create a ToDo application.

It will allow you to create new items for your todo list, show how many items you have outstanding, delete items and mark items as done! All stored in a database.

Right now we'll focus purely on some HTML for what our ToDo application should look like.

By the end of this tutorial we should have a web page that looks similar to the image below.
